<h1>Plant Disease Detection</h1>
<p>Plant Disease Detection is an innovative machine learning project that harnesses the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and deep learning techniques to identify and classify diseases in plants. The primary objective 
  is to offer farmers and agricultural experts a valuable tool for swift plant health diagnosis, facilitating timely intervention and minimizing the risk of crop loss.</p>

<h2>Project structure</h2>
<p>The project comprises essential components:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Plant_Disease_Detection.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with the code for model training.</li>
  <li>main_app.py: Streamlit web application for plant disease prediction.</li>
  <li>plant_disease_model.h5: Pre-trained model weights.</li>
  <li>requirements.txt: List of necessary Python packages.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Model Training</h2>
<p>The model was trained using the Plant_Disease_Detection.ipynb notebook. It employs a Convolutional Neural Network architecture to classify plant images into different disease categories. The trained model weights are saved in plant_disease_model.h5.</p>
<h2>Web Application</h2>
<p>The web application (main_app.py) empowers users to interact with the trained model. Upload plant images, and the application provides real-time predictions regarding the health of the plant.</p>
<h2>Required Libraries</h2>
<ul>
  <li>tensorflow-cpu</li>
  <li>streamlit</li>
  <li>numpy</li>
  <li>pandas</li>
  <li>pillow</li>
  <li>keras</li>
  <li>matplotlib</li>
</ul>
